Car Racing Game with AI Opponent

This project is a simple car racing game implemented in Python using the Pygame library. The game features player-controlled car movement, AI-controlled opponent car, adjustable difficulty levels, collision detection, scoring system, and a background image for visual appeal.

Features

Player-controlled car: Use arrow keys to move the car left and right.
AI-controlled opponent car: Autonomous opponent car adds challenge to gameplay.
Difficulty levels: Choose from easy, medium, and hard difficulty settings.
Collision detection: Game detects collisions with obstacles and opponent car.
Scoring system: Keep track of dodged obstacles to achieve high scores.
Background image: Enhance visual appeal with a background image.


Heuristic Approach

In addition to basic gameplay features, the project incorporates a heuristic approach to enhance the behavior of the AI-controlled opponent car:

Path Planning: Utilizes A* or Dijkstra's algorithm for optimal pathfinding.
Collision Avoidance: Implements sensors to detect obstacles and avoid collisions.
Adaptive Speed Control: Adjusts speed based on track conditions and proximity to other cars.
Behavioral Patterns: Simulates human-like driving behavior for realistic gameplay.
Learning and Improvement: Integrates reinforcement learning techniques for continuous improvement of AI car's driving skills.
By combining these heuristic techniques, the AI opponent car demonstrates intelligent and realistic behavior, providing a challenging and engaging experience for players.
